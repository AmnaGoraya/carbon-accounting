# Ignite Procurement: Carbon Accounting 
[![CC BY-SA 4.0][cc-by-sa-shield]][cc-by-sa]

A public github repository describing the carbon accounting methodology of Ignite Procurement, as well as our version of the spend-based emission factors available in the Exiobase database. As we want our greenhouse gas estimates to be both as transparent and accurate as possible, any and all feedback is very welcome, either as a PR to the repository or by email to [mathias.backsaether@ignite.no](mathias.backsaether@ignite.no). Note that this is a work in progress, and that changes will occur over time.
